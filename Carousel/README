Adaptive Images:

1. Append the given .htaccess file in the adaptive-images folder to your existing .htaccess file
   (.htaccess is a hidden file so you may need to adjust settings in order to reveal hidden files)

2. Add the adaptive-images.php file to the document-root of your server (where your .htaccess file is also located).

3. Add this line of JavaScript as high in the <head> of your site as possible, before any other JS:â€¨
   <script>document.cookie='resolution='+Math.max(screen.width,screen.height)+'; path=/';</script>

   An example of this can be found in our index.html



More detailed instructions can be found in the instructions.htm file in the adaptive images folder or
at the adaptive images website http://adaptive-images.com/details.htm


If you have problems getting Adaptive Images to work, the Carousel can also be used without it, and
Adaptive Images can be added later.
